# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data_Final-Project
 The analysis file is run_analysis.R 
 
 The following step-by-step tasks were done by the analysis file:
 1. Download the data zip file and unzip the files
 2. Read both training and test data sets
 3. Appropriately labels the data sets with descriptive variable names
 4. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
 5. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
 6. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 7. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
